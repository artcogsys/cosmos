# CoMoS
Cognitive Modeling Suite

This is the starting point for the modeling work we will do within LII and beyond. Ideally,
we have one framework in which we can build artificial brains that can be conditioned on
data or used as the brains of RL agents. 

At the same time, we want to disseminate the state of the art models we have been 
developing. The question is how to do this optimally.

Let's use PyTorch as the basis. We have CMS (to be replaced) and DRM (artificial brains) as
starting point. The question is whether we want to have one large framework in which 
all of this finds a place.

Note that if CMS is developed well then it should be able to accept a DRM-style model
as input.

I can imagine that exotic and older models find their place in separate repositories.

Umut I suggest that you take over from Max in developing the software dissemination part
on our website and how to link this to code.

Next steps:
* Decide on structure; How to we organize our code base?
* Decide on framework: how much do we want to copy from CMS
* How to make an impact with our work and maximize benefit?
